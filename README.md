# CodeKata_RomanNumerals

Here this program involves working on Roman Numerals.
Since the Librarian is in Rome, he does not know to use decimal numbers and he wants to perform Addition/Subtraction operation on these Roman Numbers.
So i have created a library for the book keeper to add and subtract easily.

The logic used here is to create a table look up and then convert the numbers to decimal.
Use them to perform addition/ subtraction.
Then convert them back to Roman Numerals, in this function several test cases have to be considered.

The library consists of three files,
roman_header.h-> It is a header file consisting of all the headers and function prototype
roman_1.c-> consists of all the function definitions.
roman_numerals.c-> It is the main file where values can be initialized to perform the operation.
